However I noticed several performance degrades and functionality problems when compared with my Android phone hotspot using the same sim.I had setup a remote desktop connection which I could access across the room to connect to my office computer which didn't have a very good keyboard and that stopped working.Secondly, my Jio data connection became unstable from time to time randomly, the data connection would switch off although the WiFi showed aas connected.Another issue was I had setup a hidden WiFi and my laptops need to be manually connected to the WiFi each time I turn them on or wake them up from suspend. They however connect flawlessly to my hidden office network.Finally, in spite of installing the Jio call app thrice ( hoping for an update with a fix), it sees the Jiofi but when it tries to configure it says that service cannot be currently initialized.It's been a while since I've seen such pathetic low quality Chinese hardware. I'm not blaming the Chinese but Jio for being cheap and trying to increase their profit margin at the customer's expense. Needless to say, I'll get rid of their sim once my plan expires.Its 21 deg C where I live and although I connect only 1 device at a time, the dongle heats up quite a lot.
